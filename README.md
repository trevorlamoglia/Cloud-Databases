# Overview

This is my Cloud Databases learning project. My intent was to learn and hone my skills in programming as a software engineer and to further improve my skills in my career. To do that, I decided to learn about the basics of Cloud Databases and add that into my set of skills.

The purpose of writing this software is to create a database of Filipino food and where the best city/town in the Philippines you can get it from.

# Cloud Database

Cloud Firestore is a flexible, scalable database for mobile, web, and server development from Firebase and Google Cloud.Like Firebase Realtime Database, it keeps your data in sync across client apps through realtime listeners and offers offline support for mobile and web so you can build responsive apps that work regardless of network latency or Internet connectivity.

# Development Environment

- Python 3.9 64-bit
- Visual Studio Code
- Git / GitHub
- Cloud Firestore

Visual Studio Code, also commonly referred to as VS Code, is a source-code editor made by Microsoft for Windows, Linux and macOS. Features include support for debugging, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, code refactoring, and embedded Git.

Python is a programming language with objects, modules, threads, and automatic memory management. Python is a very simple language, and has very straightforward syntax that programmers fall in love with including me.

Cloud Firestore is a flexible, scalable database for mobile, web, and server development from Firebase and Google Cloud. Cloud Firestore is a cloud-hosted, NoSQL database that your Apple, Android, and web apps can access directly via native SDKs. Cloud Firestore is also available in native Node.js, Java, Python, Unity, C++ and Go SDKs, in addition to REST and RPC APIs.
